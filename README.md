# Quick reference

Nothing special, just adds aws-cli v2 on top of official [Gradle image](https://hub.docker.com/_/gradle). This is to 
support interactions with AWS (deployment, publishing/downloading artifacts) in Bitbucket Pipelines, but can be used 
elsewhere as well. 

`amd64` and `arm64` architectures are supported at this moment.

Maintained by: [Bitweb OÃœ](https://bitweb.ee). Updates are published every Sunday.

# Supported tags

Only Gradle versions supported by [Gradle](https://endoflife.date/gradle) are published.

Supported Java versions: 8, 11, 17, 21, 25.

If the version you need is not listed, or you need different architecture, please contact Bitweb at [tech@bitweb.ee](mailto:tech@bitweb.ee).

# Usage in Bitbucket Pipelines

It's recommended to specify only major version, this way you'll stay up-to-date with security and other updates.

## Deployment

Deployment is done automatically to Docker Hub from master branch. Updates are automatically done every Sunday. 

New Gradle/JDK versions need to be added manually.

Tags with patch versions will not be tolerated and provided.

## Adding a new version (tag)

1. Create a new Pipeline step (in `bitbcuket-pipelines.yml`), that extends base step and specifies deployment name and 
description. Deployment name must follow the following convention: _{gradle-version}-{jdk-version}_ Dots are not 
allowed, so remove them: 7.3-jdk11 -> 73-jdk11
2. Add the step to master list
3. Update readme
4. Create the deployment environment in production [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/bitwebou/infra-docker-gradle-awscli/admin/pipelines/deployment-settings)
5. Add deployment variable with name _VERSION_ and value as tag name from base Gradle image
6. Push and validate
7. Update README in Docker Hub. Skip _Deployment_ and _Adding a new version_ headings.

# TODO

* `latest` tag (needs separating gradle image and our image tag in deployment)
